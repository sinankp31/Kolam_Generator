# Kolam Generator

A procedural art generator for creating traditional Indian Kolam designs using Python. This project uses computational geometry to generate intricate patterns based on a dot grid, motifs, and symmetry rules.

## Features

-   Generate dot grids of any size.
-   Define custom geometric motifs.
-   Apply transformations (translation, rotation) to create complex patterns.
-   Render and save Kolams as high-quality PNG images.
